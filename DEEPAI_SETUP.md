# DeepAI Setup Guide

## Current Status

✅ **API Key Found**: Your `.env` file contains a DeepAI API key: `dcceba12-5a62-477f-a08c-cb425e2b45b8`

❌ **API Credits Exhausted**: The DeepAI API is returning "Out of API credits - please enter payment info in your dashboard"

## Why Quotes Are Not Coming from DeepAI

The main issue is that your DeepAI account has run out of API credits. The app is working correctly:

1. ✅ **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file is being loaded properly
2. ✅ **API Key**: Your API key is valid and being used
3. ✅ **Error Handling**: The app gracefully falls back to local quotes when DeepAI fails
4. ❌ **API Credits**: DeepAI requires payment to continue generating quotes

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Add Credits to DeepAI (Recommended)

1. **Go to DeepAI Dashboard**: https://deepai.org/dashboard
2. **Add Payment Information**: Enter your credit card or payment method
3. **Purchase Credits**: DeepAI offers various credit packages
4. **Test the API**: Once credits are added, the app will automatically start using AI quotes

### Option 2: Use Local Quotes Only

If you don't want to pay for DeepAI credits, you can disable AI quotes:

```dart
// In lib/services/hive_quote_service.dart, line 54
static bool useAIQuotes = false;
```

This will make the app use only the local quotes stored in Hive.

## Current Behavior

- **With valid API key and credits**: App will fetch AI-generated quotes from DeepAI
- **Without credits**: App gracefully falls back to local quotes (current state)
- **Developer toggle**: You can easily switch between AI and local quotes using the `useAIQuotes` flag

## Testing DeepAI Status

You can check the DeepAI status programmatically:

```dart
String status = await HiveQuoteService.getDeepAIStatus();
print(status);
```

This will return messages like:
- "DeepAI available - API key valid" (when working)
- "DeepAI credits exhausted - please add payment info to dashboard" (current state)
- "DeepAI not configured - no .env file found" (if missing .env)

## Troubleshooting

1. **"API credits exhausted"**: Add payment info to your DeepAI dashboard
2. **"Authentication failed"**: Check that your API key is correct
3. **App crashes**: The NotInitializedError has been fixed with better error handling
4. **No AI quotes**: Either add credits or set `useAIQuotes = false`

## Summary

Your app is working correctly! The issue is simply that DeepAI requires payment to continue generating quotes. You can either:
- Add credits to continue using AI-generated quotes
- Use local quotes only by setting `useAIQuotes = false`

The app will work seamlessly either way.
